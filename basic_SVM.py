# idea:
# get word vector (online) -> weight with TF-IDF (program this) to get document vectors
# remove the category "BOTH", merge into "ELECTION"
# use support vector machines to classify (library), 2 layer structure
# 1. does the document contain a story? Y -> 2; N -> NONE
# 2. is the story an election story? -> Y -> ELECTION; N - > NONELECTION
# Confusion Matrix
